## Getting started

- Install `uv`
- `uv tool install multi-workspace`
- Install Docker + open it
- `./scripts/setup.sh`
- Enter an admin login
- Control C to skip creating a Google OAuth setup when it prompts you
- Open in Cursor / Restart Cursor if it was open already
- Use the Cursor Debug runnable that says "everything"


## iOS
- MIT Guest WiFI will not work unless you are using simulator
- cd into the iOS folder then:
  - `tuist install`
  - `tuist generate`
- Edit Constants.swift to enter the IP address (local LAN IP address) of your computer so that your phone can talk to it

Ask Gabe if you have any issues or want to deploy.
